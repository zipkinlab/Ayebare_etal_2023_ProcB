# Figures, and computation of niche overlap indices 

1. `Detection_probability.R`: Contains code to generate community mean detection probabilities for birds in each vegetation type (Appendix S7:Figure S1).
2. `Figures_niche_indices.R`: Contains code to generate figures showing results from niche overlap indices, and to compute elevation, diet and foraging vertical strata niche overlap indices.
3. `JSDM_output.R`: Contains code to generate figures (4a,b) showing results from the community model extension used to estimate residual correlations among species pairs of warblers.
