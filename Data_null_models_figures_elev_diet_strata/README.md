# Data null model distributions ( elevation, diet, forest strata)

**Folder contents**: contains 4 files (i.e., prop.weak.overlap.samples.elev, prop.strong.overlap.samples.elev, prop.weak.overlap.samples.d, prop.strong.overlap.samples.d, prop.weak.overlap.samples.s, prop.strong.overlap.samples.s ).

**Purpose**: Generated to assess whether the observed niche overlap indices for the 60 species pairs were significantly different from random null expectations (i.e., across families) for elevation, diet and foraging vertical strata niche dimensions.

1. **`prop.weak.overlap.samples.elev.csv`**

   + **Variables**
      * col 1: Proportion of weak elevation niche overlap indices for 60 species pairs. Note: elevation niche partitioning is considered weak when the index is < 0.5 
      * Sp_* : Unique identification for bird species (63) within the community (full species names are provided in Appendix S5).
    
2. **`prop.strong.overlap.samples.elev.csv`**

   + **Variables**
     * col 1: Proportion of strong elevation niche overlap indices for 60 species pairs. Note: elevation niche partitioning is considered strong when the index is â‰¥ 0.5. 
     * Sp_* : Unique identification for bird species (63) within the community (full species names are provided in Appendix S5).
       
3. **`prop.weak.overlap.samples.d.csv`**
   + **Variables**
     * col 1: Proportion of weak diet niche overlap indices considering 60 species pairs. Note: diet niche partitioning is considered weak when index is < 0.5  
     * Sp_* :  Unique identification for bird species (63) within the community (full species names are provided in Appendix S5).
    
4. **`prop.strong.overlap.samples.d.csv`**
   + **Variables**
     * col 1: Proportion of strong diet niche overlap indices considering 60 species pairs. Note: diet niche partitioning is considered strong when index is < 0.5.
     * Sp_* :  Unique identification for bird species (63) within the community (full species names are provided in Appendix S5).
     
5. **`prop.weak.overlap.samples.s.csv`**
   + **Variables**
      * col 1: Proportion of weak vertical foraging forest strata niche overlap indices considering 60 species pairs. Note: diet niche partitioning is considered weak when index is < 0.5. 
      * Sp_* : Unique identification for species (63) within the community (Full species names are provided in Appendix S5).
    
 6. **`prop.strong.overlap.samples.s.csv`**
    + **Variables**
       * col 1: Proportion of strong vertical foraging forest strata niche overlap indices considering 60 species pairs. Note: vertical foraging forest strata niche partitioning is considered strong when index is < 0.5 
       * Sp_* : Unique identification for species (63) within the community (Full species names are provided in Appendix S5).
