# Supplementary Material - Appendix S1: Rank abundance plots

1. `Rank_abundance_plots.R`: Contains code to generate rank abundance plots to assess robustness of our single visit point count data (i.e., estimating abundance)
in relation to a multi-year (i.e., 5 years) and longer duration point counts (10-min point counts).
