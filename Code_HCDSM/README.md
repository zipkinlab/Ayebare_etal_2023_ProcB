# R scripts to fit hierarchical community distance sampling models

1. `Virunga_HCDSM63.R`: Contains code to format data and to fit a hierarchical community distance sampling model for 63 bird species relating their abundance along an elevation gradient.
2. `Virunga_warblers_jsdm_elevation.R`: Contains code to format data and to fit a hierarchical community distance sampling model to estimate residual correlations among five warbler species (Cisticolidae)  after accounting for the effect of elevation.
3. `Virunga_warblers_jsdm_null.R`: Contains code to format data and to fit a hierarchical community distance sampling model to estimate residual correlations among five warbler species (Cisticolidae)  - Null model.
